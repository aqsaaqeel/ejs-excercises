/*Q-1: Write a function buildTable that, given an array of objects that all have the same set of properties, builds up a DOM structure representing a table. The table should have a header row with the property names wrapped in <th> elements and should have one subsequent row per object in the array, with its property values in <td> elements.

The Object.keys function, which returns an array containing the property names that an object has, will probably be helpful here.

Once you have the basics working, right-align cells containing numbers by setting their style.textAlign property to "right".
